# Learn-to-write-a-yes-or-no-question-in-python
Create a yes or no question in python without writing any code.
To start the components of the program must be selected in proper order.
The if statment, while loop, break statment, must be in the proper
order before starting.
To skip the questions and not arrange the components press m to go to the yes or no question. 
Select x to exit before starting.
To run the yes or no question copy and paste it into a .py file or python IDE.
This is best used when the user has a basic knowledge of while loops, variables, input function and if statments. A new file was added that has a single line string and simple greeting.
This is usefull for someone just starting to learn python.
